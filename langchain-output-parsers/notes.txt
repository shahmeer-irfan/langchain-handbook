Output Parsers in langchian converts raw LLM responses into structured format like
JSON
CSV 
pydantic models

they ensure validation and ease of use in applications.

types of output parsers:
string outputparser
json outputparser
structured outputparser
pydantic outputparser 

1) string output parser is used to parse the output of llm and return it as a plain string.
//we dont need to use result.content, if we use strOutputParser.


2) converts output into JSON.
//we cannot enforce any schema in JSON OutputParsers.

3) StructuredOutputParser helps extract structured JSON using predefined schema(Response Schema).
//NO DATA validation

4)Pydantic Output Parser is a structured output parser in langchain that uses Pydantic Models to enforce schema validation when processing llm response.
//strict schema/type safety/automatic validation/works well with other components

In LangChain, a  partial variable refers to a way of pre-filling some of the input variables 
for a chain or prompt template ahead of time â€” essentially making a "partially completed" version of it.
This is especially useful when you know certain values in advance and want to avoid passing them 
every time you invoke the chain.
