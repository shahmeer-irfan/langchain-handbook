# LangChain Playbook by Shahmeer Irfan

Welcome to my **LangChain Playbook** — a complete, organized, and hands-on guide that documents everything I've learned while exploring **LangChain**, the leading framework for building applications with **large language models (LLMs)**.

This repository includes code, explanations, and real-world examples covering **all major components** of LangChain — from prompts and chains to agents, tools, memory, RAG, output parsers, and beyond.

> 🚀 Created and maintained by **Shahmeer Irfan**, an aspiring AI Engineer.
