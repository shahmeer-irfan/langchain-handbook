<h1>LangChain Models - Boilerplate Project</h1>

  <p>This project contains boilerplate code for understanding how different types of models are implemented in <strong>LangChain</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>chatmodels/</strong> - Contains examples using <code>ChatModel</code> interfaces such as OpenAI Chat, ChatAnthropic, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>llm/</strong> - Contains code for working with base LLMs using the <code>LLM</code> interface (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>embeddings/</strong> - Includes boilerplate code for generating and using embeddings via the <code>Embeddings</code> interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The goal is to understand the basic implementation and usage of different model types provided by LangChain.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>Each folder contains simple and focused examples for initializing and using the respective model type. You can run and modify them to explore how LangChain integrates with LLM providers and embedding services.</p>
