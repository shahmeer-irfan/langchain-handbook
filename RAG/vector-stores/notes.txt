suppose you have movie recommendation system. you want to show ssimilar movies to user based on their plot.
but you cannot do that directly
first you will get all the plot of movies through some api
then you will generate embeddings then you will have to store embeddings and do intelligent semantic Search
because normal semantic search will take alot of time for millions of movies
these are challenges you face during building this app
and all these challenges can be solved by VECTOR STORES.

VECTOR STORE is a system designed to store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors.
It uses indexing algorithms to find required query.
It also provides CRUD Operations


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VECTOR STORES AND VECTOR Databases
-> vector stores provide storage and retrieval options.
-> where as when you associaite db properties with vector stores then it's known as vector database.

Vector stores in langchain (FAISS, Pinecone,Chroma,Qdrant, Weaviate)
they all share same interface
from_documents()
add_document()
similarity_search(query, k=)

Chroma is a lightweight, open source vector database that is especially friendly for local development and small-to-medium scale production needs.
It lies between vector stores and vector db
tenant->database->collection->documents->embedding vector and metadata about that vector
