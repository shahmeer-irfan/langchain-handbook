Components of RAG:
Document Loaders
Text Splitters 
Vector Databases 
 Retrievers

->Document Loaders:
They are used to load data from various sources into standardized format(usually as Document objects), which can then be used 
for chunking, embedding, retrieval, and generation.
Document(
    pag_content="asdsd"
    meta_data=""
)

WE CAN ALSO MAKE CUSTOM DOCUMENT LOADERS BY INHERITING CUSTOM CLASS FROM LANGCHAIN.


-> Text Splitters:
 it is a process of breaking large chunks of text into smaller, manageabe pieces(chunks) that an LLM can handle effectively. 
 > There is a limit on how much tokens can llm take at once.
 benifits:
 helps in embeddings, semantic Search, and summarization.
